**⚠️THIS IS A DRAFT AND IT IS NOT FINISHED⚠️**

# strafes.net-moderation-document-draft

This is a rule draft sheet for the strafes.net moderator team to revise and for the public to read.

The reason of this respiratory is to make the ruleset strict with exile of human determination, moderation with bias is subject to favor or disservice others, removing this creates fairness for all players and keeps a constant logic.
