## Handshow
```
Hello, some of the {surf/bhop} mods {(including me)} have noticed a handful of times/replays that look very suspicious. We'd like to request a handshow on the following map(s):
{maps}
We recommend using OBS to record your screen in addition to the phone/camera capture and providing both. A proper handshow should:

Have a monitor completely visible
Have keyboard completely visible or at least A/D keys
Have mouse visible
Show computer restart
Show all processes in task manager
Show startup programs in task manager
Show bottom right arrow (Show hidden icons) and mouse over all programs
Audio should be enabled
Close all programs on taskbar that aren't Roblox, **do not open anything not necessary for handshow**
If something is not easily visible (such as task manager) then the handshow is invalid

There is no deadline for this, and moving forward it's unlikely you will be punished unless you continue to set times that are suspicious. We're requesting this as a precaution, not as a punishment. My DM's are always open if you have any questions. For more specifics, go to https://github.com/insyri/strafes.net-moderation-document-draft/blob/main/info/how-to-handshow.md to see more.
