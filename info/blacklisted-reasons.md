# Blacklist Reasons
In-game, you can be blacklisted for a number of different reasons with sub-specific reasons, this document aims to explain those.
## Cheating
### Time Submit
Submitting times that don't have bots, any time less than 0 seconds is automatically blacklisted for this reason.
### Angle Change
Manipulating the user's view/camera to seem forward when on serverside are facing in another direction, this would often be abused in styles such as Backwards or Sideways to assist the user with the camera view.
### Autostrafe
Using a macro to bind a button to the user's mouse movement AND actively press the key to move in-game (pressing `a` simultaneously moves the user left and rotate the camera), having it sync for the user. This is different from [Turn Binds](https://github.com/insyri/strafes.net-moderation-document-draft/blob/main/rules/allowed.md#turn-binds) because turn binds are single input single output.
### Speedgain
Manipulating the user's movement speed or position to either slow down or speed up; numerically modifying the user's speed.
### Autoscroll
Binding the scroll wheel up/down to any other input or systematically triggering scroll via scripts.
### Nulls
Preventing the user from pressing a key to achieve/aim for perfect/close to perfect sync; nullifying/disabling a button to register.
### SHSW Binds
Binds that are used for the Half-Sideways style to `A`,`D` instead of the regular `A`,`D`,`W`. [One input, one ouput.](https://github.com/insyri/strafes.net-moderation-document-draft/blob/main/rules/allowed.md#key-binding)
### Timescale
Manipulating the in-game time to either slow down or speed up the user.
*Note: using the `/timescale` command IS allowed, but it does not submit the user's time. Using injections to bypass this, blacklistable.*
### Ladder Boosting
Abuse of using ladders to boost over the edge to instantly gain units.
### Modified Physics
Modifying physics to advange. This includes breaking `/freecam`.
## Glitch
### Wrong Map
Saving a time on another map that is not the map that is currently being used on purpose.
### Wall Clip
No-clipping through walls by the specific use of glitches, if it is cheats being used to wall clip, then it is Modified Physics.
### Anticheat Abuse
Re-entering startzone after touching an anti cheat block.
### Collision Bug Exploit
Hitting a corner where multiple parts meet which results in you teleporting to the origin point.
*Note: better explained with a [visual example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2eeKD0nwg)*
## Alternate Account

## Suspicious
This category is most commonly used when the moderator isn't 100% on the reason, or legitimacy, but knows it doesn't make sense either way.
