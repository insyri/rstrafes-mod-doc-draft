# Blacklist Reasons
In-game, you can be blacklisted for a number of different reasons with sub-specific reasons, this doc aims to explain those.
## Cheating
### Time Submit
Submitting times that don't have bots, any time less than 0 seconds is automatically blacklisted for thi reason.
### Angle Change
Manipulating the user's view/camera to seem forward when on serverside are facing in another direction, this would often be abused in styles such as Backwards or Sideways to assist the user with the camera view.
### Autostrafe
Using an AutoHotkey or Macro to bind to `a`, `d`, `s`, or `w` to your mouse movement, having it sync for the user. This is **different** from [Turn Binds](https://github.com/insyri/strafes.net-moderation-document-draft/new/main/rules#turn-binds). However, using turnbinds to optimize your strafes is blacklistable. Automatic strafes done by exploits, commonly these strafes inhumanly fast and are perfect either in terms of velocity, sync, and/or directional turns.
### Speedgain
Outside acceleration applied to the user to increase the local's units per second/speed.
### Autoscroll
Binding the scroll wheel up/down to any other input or systematically triggering scroll via scripts.
### Nulls
Preventing the user from pressing a key to achieve/aim for perfect/close to perfect sync; nullifying/disabling a button to register.
### SHSW Binds
Binds that are used for the Half-Sideways style to us `A`,`D` instead of the regular `A`,`D`,`W`
### Timescale
Manipulating the in-game time to either slow down or speed up the user.
*Note: using the `/timescale` command IS allowed, but it does not submit your time. Using injections to bypass this, blacklistable.*
### Ladder Boosting
Abuse of using ladders to boost over the edge to instantly gain units.
*insyri- shouldnt this be in gltich cat.?*
### Modified Physics
Modifying physics to advange. This includes breaking `/freecam`.
## Glitch
### Wrong Map
Saving a time one another map that is not the map that is currently being used.
### Wall Clip
No-clipping through walls by the specific use of glitch, if it is cheats being used to wall clip, then it is Modified Physics.
### Anticheat Abuse
Re-entering startzone after touching an anti cheat block.
### Collision Bug Exploit
Hitting a corner where multiple parts meet which results in you teleporting to the origin point(?). (Courtesy of y_Mia)
*Note: better explained with a [visual example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2eeKD0nwg)*
