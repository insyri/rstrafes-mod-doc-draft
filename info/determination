# Determination
*Determination as in how we determine "things", not determination as in "firmness of purpose; resoluteness".*
This document is made to clarify how we, the moderation decision makers, make decisions among **rules**, specifically implementation.

There is no strict determination on how we approve new rules for implementation.
Usually, it is determined by majority acceptance in which who participate. There is no 'all votes counted' or 'I'm right so it should/should not be implemented', it is just the majority of the participating debaters.

<sub>why did i make a document for just this?</sub>
