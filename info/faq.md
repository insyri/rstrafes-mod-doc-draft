# FAQ

## I can't see my times!
When you put in pending or blacklisted, your times disappear to the public, only moderators can see your deleted times.
## Can I appeal after 6+ months of being blacklisted for cheating?
For now, we are not accepting appeals for cheating after the moderation update, after anti-cheat release, we will then make a solid decision on this. *3/10/2021, this is said BEFORE the anti-cheat release.*
