# FAQ

## I can't see my times!
When you put in pending or blacklisted, your times disappear to the public, only moderators can see your deleted times.
## Can I appeal for my blacklisted state?
Yes! In-game moderation appeals are being revamped. First time offenders who were blacklisted for cheating can now appeal their blacklist if it has been 4 months since their original blacklist. To create an appeal, use the new google form: https://forms.gle/6cYxrA2XdUvRE1me7. **The old form and the issue tracker are not being used**, so use this form if you want your appeal to be read. After making an appeal, please wait up to 24 hours after you create the appeal before contacting a moderator about it.
## Can you blacklist me? I'm quitting.
No, if you want to be blacklisted just go cheat.
## I have an alt in pending, can you review the time?
We are no longer whitelisting alternative accounts.
