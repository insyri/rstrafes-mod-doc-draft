# Handshow Guide
This is a document dedicated to the rules and clarity of recording a handshow that was requested by moderators.
This does not apply to handshows that were not asked by mods, but is endorsed.

## Recording

A handshow consists of two video inputs:
1. The camera for showing the hand movement.
2. The recoding for the screen.

### Hand Recording
Rules follow for hand recording:
1. Whole mousepad/hand must be visible at all times during the show.
2. Sound recording must be loud enough to hear the mouse dragging around lightly; must be able to hear clicks.
3. Surroundings must be well lit, it should be easy to see the contents of the video. [This is an example of a NOT well lit room](<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e6/d8/e8/e6d8e8488a1c1f7d35f8c3785bf3363e.jpg"/>).

#### Rules Regarding Camera/Webcam Capture Quality

We agknowledge some of us are not as fortunate to have a spare webcam or camera lying around, there are alternatives to which you use but it is recommended that you get a camera that contains the following qualities:
- At least 144x144 resolution
- At least 30 frames per second capture
- 

## Post Recording
- No skipping, cutting, filtering, or editing of any kind after recording the video.
- File type must be previewable somehow without downloading the video, whether on a website or on the discord client/app.
