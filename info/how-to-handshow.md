# Handshow Guide
This is a document dedicated to the recommendations and clarity of recording a handshow that were requested by moderators.
This does not apply to handshows that were not asked by mods, but is endorsed.

This is incomplete and needs revision.

## TL;DR

- Have a monitor completely visible
- Have keyboard completely visible or at least A/D keys
- Have mouse visible
- Show computer restart
- Show all processes in task manager
- Show startup programs in task manager
- Show bottom right arrow (Show hidden icons) and mouse over all programs
- Audio should be enabled
- Close all programs on taskbar that aren't Roblox, **do not open anything not necessary for handshow**
- If something is not easily visible (such as task manager) then the handshow is invalid

## Recording

A handshow consists of two video inputs:
1. The camera for showing the hand movement.
2. The recording for the screen.

### Hand Recording
Recommendations for hand recording:
1. Whole relevant mousepad/hand must be visible at all times during the show. (Relevant means the space used.)
2. Surroundings must be at least dim enough to see the mouse shape clearly without the possible RGB lighting on. [This is an example of a NOT well lit room](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e6/d8/e8/e6d8e8488a1c1f7d35f8c3785bf3363e.jpg).
#### Recording Content
- Computer restart
- Task Manager Processes and start up processes
- [Hidden Icons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60794909/110715522-635c2d80-81d3-11eb-8480-90c8071c9446.png)
- Taskbar
- Mouse
- Monitor
- Audio
- Keyboard (At least the keys you use)

## Post Recording
For a 100% handshow, editing for cutting, skipping, or filtering is not recommended. If you think you can improve something for the handshow via editing, like syncing unsynced video sources, then it makes sense. **If it doesn't change anything when edited in relation to the raw, it is probably OK,** but it's easier not to edit at all.

Sharing the recording is recommended to be previewable without local computer downloads, you can put your video on YouTube, Streamable, Medal, and if you want to send it through Discord, you can compress the video down to requirements at [8mb.video](https://8mb.video/), just make sure it isn't too compressed. If you are sending through Discord, make sure it's in an mp4 format, else, you should convert it to an mp4 via any website you trust or local computing.

Handshow camera and screen recording can be seperate uploads.
