# Handshow Guide
This is a document dedicated to the rules and clarity of recording a handshow that was requested by moderators.
This does not apply to handshows that were not asked by mods, but is endorsed.

## Recording

## Post Recording
- No skipping, cutting, filtering, or editing of any kind after recording the video.
- File type must be previewable somehow without downloading the video, whether on a website or on the discord client/app.
