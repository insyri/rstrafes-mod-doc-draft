# Handshow Guide
This is a document dedicated to the rules and clarity of recording a handshow that was requested by moderators.
This does not apply to handshows that were not asked by mods, but is endorsed.

## Recording

A handshow consists of two video inputs:
1. The camera for showing the hand movement.
2. The recording for the screen.

### Hand Recording
Rules follow for hand recording:
1. Whole mousepad/hand must be visible at all times during the show.
2. Sound recording must be loud enough to hear the mouse dragging around lightly; must be able to hear clicks.
3. Surroundings must be at least dim enough to see the mouse shape clearly without the possible RGB lighting on. [This is an example of a NOT well lit room](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e6/d8/e8/e6d8e8488a1c1f7d35f8c3785bf3363e.jpg).
#### Rules Regarding Camera/Webcam Capture Quality
Any/most cameras have all these features, if your camera exceed the following
We agknowledge some of us are not as fortunate to have a spare webcam or camera lying around, there are alternatives to which you use but it is recommended that you get a camera that contains the following qualities:
- At least around 144x144 resolution (as export to upload as well)
- At least 24 frames per second capture
Stated above is not strict, the bottom line is that **it should be easy to see the hand and hand movement**.

## Post Recording
- No skipping, cutting, filtering, or editing of any kind after or before recording the video that directly affects the hand view.
[chris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOSiWzkuMz8) has a video with a good example of editing that does not affect the hand view.

Rule of thumb is this: if it doesn't change anything when editied in relative to the undedited, it is probably okay. However it is just easier to not edit it at all.
- File type must be previewable somehow without downloading the video, whether on a website or on the discord client/app.
If your camera takes footage in a file format not supported by discord previewing, convert it using an online application to mp4.
