# The Moderation Process
There are four status\'s.
- Normal
- Pending
- Whitelisted
- Blacklisted
## Normal
Moderation status starts as this, when a user joins for first time, this is the user's set status. As this you can:
- Get new times
- Appear on leaderboards
- CANNOT hold WRs and get WR announcements, if you get a WR and the user's status is 'normal', you are set to pending status. (You cannot hold a WR as normal, you must be verified.)
## Pending
As pending you can:
- Get new times
- CANNOT appear on the leaderboard
- CANNOT hold WRs and get WR announcements, if you are approved by moderators, the user's status is set to whitelisted.
## Whitelisted
Permissions:
- Get new times
- Appear on leaderboards
- Hold WRs and get WR announcements, however, if you are a suspected cheater, the user's moderation status is set to blacklisted.
## Blacklisted
Blacklisted permissions are 0, meaning you:
- CANNOT get new times
- CANNOT appear on leaderboards
- CANNOT hold WRs and get WR announcements
# Blacklist Logic
As blacklisted, a user may appeal to be whitelisted; accept and reject. When an appeal is accepted, a deleter deletes all offending times and unblacklists the user, in some cases, this may be a time wipe.

If a user is blacklisted from the system, the appeal may only be accepted if the system made a mistake.

Some blacklists are temporary, others are permanent; once the temporary blacklist is over, the user gets time wiped unless an active appeal is made, in that case it may be either a time wipe or individual time deletions.
