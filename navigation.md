# Navigation

[Enable Dark Theme on Github (account needed)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-your-theme-settings)

We are using Github to post our rules to more efficiently handle things. <sub>also google docs is shit</sub>

With this, we know that not many are used to Github and for ease, we will explain the navigation to properly do so. This is the navigation bar

The only important parts here are Code, Issues, and Discussions. We are not forward to the use of pull requests, due to it's nonsensical use in this repository, but if agreed, we are not against pull requests (if you don't know what pull requests are, don't be worried).

## Code/Text
In the **Code** section, you can see all the texts about the rules and other related stuff, ignore the `.github/...` stuff, that's not part of the actual rules. As you can see, there are folders and texts that end with `.md`, all of those are texts that are part of the rules, navigating into the folders reveal more texts. You can view the context of these texts by clicking on their title name.

The left text is the title of the text/folder, the middle is the details about the latest modification, and to the right is the date when it was last modified.

This is the latest update bar, can be found on top of the texts. On the left, you can see who issued the update, then the details of the update, then on the right, the obscure numbers and letters are just the ID of the commit, then how long ago the update was issued, then how many updates in total have been issued.

## Discussions
In the **Discussions** section, you will see a few things.

The Discussions section is a place where you can give comments about the rules, categorized by suggestions/feedback and other things that might not be feedback, we put this here just in case. The big block is the pinned post, it's self explanitory. To make a new post, click the green button on the side that says "New Discussion". You can filter and search for specific discussions using the buttons below the big block. You can sort by discussion category below the search bar.

This is a post, you can comment, react, edit notifications for it (if you wanna be notified for mentions only, all comments, or nothing), and if you are the poster, edit the post. If you wish to edit your post or comment, go to the top right of the box containing it, and click the sideways snowman button (triple buttons). You can upvote comments and posts on the top left outside of the box.

## Issues
In the **Issues** section, you will see a bar with utilities and possibly an actual issue. You can generate a new issue by selecting the "New Issue" button.

In the example issue, you can see the title, tags, and how long ago it was created along with who.

Alike the Discussions, with the only difference being the tags, this helps for sectioning and specifying what kind of issue this is. Issues can be resolved and closed.
