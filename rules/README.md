# Abstract

Exploiting or abusing the game is a serious offense. Moderators or administrators may put a blacklist in place to users who do not follow the rules.

When adequate evidence has been collected, staff are free to punish users within the protocols of these guidelines. The length and severity of punishments depends on the circumstances of each individual case. If a given case is severe enough, the punishment may be accordingly increased. Each case is ultimately up to moderator discretion.

Provided below are examples of potential banworthy offenses. Certain cases may arise that are not outlined in the following rules. It is up to the staff team to determine the proper case of action in these given situations.
