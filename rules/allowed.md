# Allowed
This section provides clarity to what is allowed that is questionable.

## FPS Unlocker
Using the [unofficial Roblox FPS Unlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker) is allowed in the game. [Roblox does allow allow using this](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/does-roblox-allow-the-use-of-fps-unlockers/486458/2), it only changes data in the memory, so it is not injecting.

## Turn Binds
Turn bind scripts are allowed but are limited to one key press performing a single action or output (mouse movement). This is inclusive of keys which already have functions in game.

## INTEGRATED Timescale
There is an integrated command in the game, `/timescale`, as this does not save the user's time, it is there for practicing. Breaking this to save times is cheating.

## Creating Scripts
Developing exploits and scripts for cheating on the games *alone* are not blacklistable, however *using* the cheats makes you qualified for a blacklist. Holding scripts and not using them is not blacklistable, however, unmoral in most cases. >:(

Quaternions made a comment on a youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFVJyse2M_4) regarding a script tutorial.

## Telehopping
Purposefully surfing/bhopping into a trigger to respawn with more speed. (This does not apply to all maps, some may have an anti-telehop.)

## Spinning/Strafing Inside Anti-Telehop
Spaz-strafing/spinning after a stage teleport to gain speed before hitting the ground.

## Scroll Edgeboosting
See [Edgeboosting](https://github.com/insyri/strafes.net-moderation-document-draft/blob/main/rules/gameplay-sins.md#edgeboostingedgesurfing). Scroll Edgeboosting is allowed mostly because of how easy it is to accidentally edgeboost in the scroll style.

## No-Leave Startzone Heights
Height advantages where one does not have to leave the startzone (E.g. Hyperspeed) are allowed.

## Key Binding
A user may bind their keys and map them to a different key, this is, again, limited to one key press; one input, one output.
