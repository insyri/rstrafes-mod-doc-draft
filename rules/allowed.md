# Allowed
This section provides clarity to what is allowed that is questionable.

## FPS Unlocker
Using the [unofficial Roblox FPS Unlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker) is allowed in the game. [Roblox does allow allow using this](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/does-roblox-allow-the-use-of-fps-unlockers/486458/2), it only changes data in the memory, so it is not injecting.

## Turn Binds
Binding mouse movement left/right to a keyboard/mouse button.

## Creating Scripts
Developing exploits and scripts for cheating on the games *alone* are not blacklistable, however *using* the cheats makes you qualified for a blacklist.
