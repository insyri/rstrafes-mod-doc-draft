# Gameplay Injections/ Hardware Exploits
This contains the different exploits that provide **external assistance**; if enough evidence suggests that a/the user is found to utilize these, they will be issued moderation. Some items in game are purposefully added into maps, those count as internal additions which are allowed. Including but not limited to: accelerators.

## Appealable
### Timescaling
Manipulating the in-game time to either slow down or speed up the user.
*Note: using the `/timescale` command IS allowed, but it does not submit your time. Using injections to bypass this, blacklistable.*
### Gains/Gaining
Manipulating the user's movement speed or position to either slow down or speed up; adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing the user's speed/ modifying the user's position, teleportation for example.
### Angle Changing
Manipulating the user's view/camera to seem forward when on serverside are facing in another direction, this would often be abused in styles such as Backwards or Sideways to assist the user with the camera view. <sub>note: provide visual example</sub>
### Virtual Reality/VR
A feature on Roblox that can be abused to angle change, use of virtual reality headsets in-game is prohibited.
### Scrolling (Section)
*Appearance of constant or close to constant scroll on scroll styled runs will be assumed to one of these. Scripts enabling this advantage via software or hardware is also prohibited.*
#### Autoscroll
Binding the scroll wheel up/down to any other input.
#### Hyperscroll
Logitech provides a special feature in which the scroll wheel can scroll for a fast and prolonged period of time without [as much] resistance, use of this or from any other capable mouse or brand is prohibited. [Video showcase of the Logitech G G502 mouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRwPCHR5PCE).
### Autostrafe
Using an AutoHotkey or Macro to bind to `a`, `d`, `s`, or `w` to your mouse movement, having it sync for the user. This is **different** from [Turn Binds](https://github.com/insyri/strafes.net-moderation-document-draft/new/main/rules#turn-binds). However, using turnbinds to optimize your strafes is blacklistable.
### Nulls
Preventing the user from pressing a key to achieve/aim for perfect/close to perfect sync; nullifying/disabling a button to register.
