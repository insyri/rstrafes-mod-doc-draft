# Gameplay Rules
This includes any game breaking or competition scheming advantage.
## Appealable
### Alternate Account(s)
New accounts used made to cheat, or accounts that were made by an already blacklisted user.
- A account’s age is under one month old and makes it into pending, it will be blacklisted unless the identity of the account is confirmed to be a legitimate player’s account.
- Only one alternate account per world record holder (verify with a mod which account you would like to keep).
- Ban evade via alt will possibly lead to additional punishments.
- If you are caught cheating on an alternate account, all known accounts that you are associated with will be blacklisted as well.
- Players cannot get a whitelisted alt for an already blacklisted player. The alt and all known associated accounts with both players will be blacklisted if this rule is broken.
*Note: we may blacklist your alternative account just for being suspicious in any sense.*
## Warnable
### Edgeboosting
Abusing the edges of a platform in order to gain any amount of speed, usually you surf a little off of it. Jumping on the spine of surf ramps without gaining speed is not edgeboosting.
*Note: Edgeboosting rules do not apply to the Scroll category.*
### Edge Ricochet
Abusing the edge of any platform/part to abuse game mechanics and directionally push to dramatically change one's height.
### Map Skips/Glitches
Any skip that involves clipping through a part or exiting the boundaries of a map is forbidden. This also includes bouncing up to skip over another part of the map. If you have found a map bug like this, please refer and fill out the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSej_g-logtEZbykSuXpBdd0St7JIajTdN7BM_DZEJuhK6oW2A/viewform).
### Ladder Boosting
Abuse of using ladders to boost over the edge to instantly gain units.
### No title rules
- Leaving the startzone and re-entering the startzone to gain a height advantage at the start of the map or re-entering after touching an anti cheat block. (Example: Tom Cruise/Vacancy)
  - As a general rule, if you have to surf on a ramp to get on top of the anti telehop it is not allowed. (Example: Cryogen)
  - Height advantages where one does not have to leave the startzone (E.g. Hyperspeed) are allowed.
