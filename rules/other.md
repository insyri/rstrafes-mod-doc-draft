# Other Rationales For Blacklisting
## Cheating On Other Movement Games
Defining *movement games* as any game simliar to or involves bhop or strafe movement.

If a user is known for cheating or exploiting on other movement games other than rbhop/rsurf, the user is given a blacklist due to being untrustworthy; proof must be shown before counting this as a reason for a blacklist issue.

## Alternative account(s)
New accounts used made to cheat, or accounts that were made by an already blacklisted user.
- A account’s age is under one month old and makes it into pending, it will be blacklisted unless the identity of the account is confirmed to be a legitimate player’s account.
- Only one alternate account per world record holder (verify with a mod which account you would like to keep).
- Ban evade via alt will possibly lead to additional punishments.
- If you are caught cheating on an alternate account, all known accounts that you are associated with will be blacklisted as well.
- Players cannot get a whitelisted alt for an already blacklisted player. The alt and all known associated accounts with both players will be blacklisted if this rule is broken.
*Note: we may blacklist your alternative account just for being suspicious in any sense.*
